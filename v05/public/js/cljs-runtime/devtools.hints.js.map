With optimizations :none the name of the null call site can be seen.\n;\n; The enhancing handler function tries to:\n; 1) parse error's stack trace.\n; 2) look original javascript source file up (via sync AJAX fetch by default).\n; 3) locate reported line and column.\n; 4) presents problematic line with a column hint as addition to .stack or .message strings.\n\n; Technically the trick here is to override TypeError.prototype.toString\n; and global window.onerror handler to enhance uncaught errors.\n;\n; With that we should handle two situations:\n; 1) either error gets printed (typically in user's catch via console), so patched toString() method gets called.\n; 2) or it is uncaught and our global error handler should take care of possible enhancement\n;    before devtools present it to the user themselves.\n;\n; note: Tested under Chrome only\n\n(def ^:dynamic *installed* false)\n(def ^:dynamic *original-global-error-handler* nil)\n(def ^:dynamic *original-type-error-prototype-to-string* nil)\n\n(def processed-errors (volatile! nil))\n\n; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(defn set-processed-errors!
