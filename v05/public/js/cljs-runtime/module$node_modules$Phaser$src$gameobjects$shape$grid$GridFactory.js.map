You can\r\n * treat it like any other Game Object in your game, such as tweening it, scaling it, or enabling\r\n * it for input or physics. It provides a quick and easy way for you to render this shape in your\r\n * game without using a texture, while still taking advantage of being fully batched in WebGL.\r\n * \r\n * This shape supports only fill colors and cannot be stroked.\r\n * \r\n * A Grid Shape allows you to display a grid in your game, where you can control the size of the\r\n * grid as well as the width and height of the grid cells. You can set a fill color for each grid\r\n * cell as well as an alternate fill color. When the alternate fill color is set then the grid\r\n * cells will alternate the fill colors as they render, creating a chess-board effect. You can\r\n * also optionally have an outline fill color. If set, this draws lines between the grid cells\r\n * in the given color. If you specify an outline color with an alpha of zero, then it will draw\r\n * the cells spaced out, but without the lines between them.\r\n *\r\n * @method Phaser.GameObjects.GameObjectFactory#grid\r\n * @since 3.13.0\r\n *\r\n * @param {number} [x=0] - The horizontal position of this Game Object in the world.\r\n * @param {number} [y=0] - The vertical position of this Game Object in the world.\r\n * @param {number} [width=128] - The width of the grid.\r\n * @param {number} [height=128] - The height of the grid.\r\n * @param {number} [cellWidth=32] - The width of one cell in the grid.\r\n * @param {number} [cellHeight=32] - The height of one cell in the grid.\r\n * @param {number} [fillColor] - The color the grid cells will be filled with, i.e. 0xff0000 for red.\r\n * @param {number} [fillAlpha] - The alpha the grid cells will be filled with. You can also set the alpha of the overall Shape using its `alpha` property.\r\n * @param {number} [outlineFillColor] - The color of the lines between the grid cells.\r\n * @param {number} [outlineFillAlpha] - The alpha of the lines between the grid cells.\r\n *\r\n * @return {Phaser.GameObjects.Grid} The Game Object that was created.\r\n */\r\nGameObjectFactory.register('grid', function (x, y, width, height, cellWidth, cellHeight, fillColor, fillAlpha, outlineFillColor, outlineFillAlpha)\r\n{\r\n    return this.displayList.add(new Grid(this.scene, x, y, width, height, cellWidth, cellHeight, fillColor, fillAlpha, outlineFillColor, outlineFillAlpha));\r\n});\r\n\n};"],
